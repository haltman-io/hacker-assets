# hacker-assets
A community-driven archive of hacker-related images and videos. Open for everyone to contribute, preserve, and share visuals from hacker culture, events, history, and underground scenes. Curated by the community, for the community.

## Why
Because I was born too late. 

Every damn time I search for information about some older hacker or hacker group, their site is down and it's a nightmare to find any image or video to understand what it was like back then. 

History is important, and knowing who was part of the origin of hacking as we know it today is cool.

This is about storing this data so it doesn't get lost again.
