## Why

Because I was born too late to keep up with the evolution of "hacking." Now, it seems like the scene is full of magical commercial solutions.

It's hard to know the origin of everything these days.

Every damn time I search for information about some older hacker or hacker group, their site is down and it's a nightmare to find any image or video to understand what it was like back then. 

History is important, and knowing who was part of the origin of hacking as we know it today is cool.

This is about storing this data so it doesn't get lost again.
